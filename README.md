Application who lets you watch some "ANIME SERIES" at your fingertips! easy to play, easy to follow.

It's my first try to do an important application for me, it would be a pleasure to do it with some help about implanting webview-video on html5 knowledge. 

I've started to learn android since few weeks seriously, but I'm too happy to have some knowledge to develope on Android.

Thanks you very much!

Hope you enjoy it! 

I have two requests, i'd like to get some help in:

- Make a mark on a clicked row (e.g: Mark as seen)

- Improve to a better way to watch ANIME SERIES
